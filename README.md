# !!Testing channel handling!! (additional feature)

Channel handling is done by POST requests to /chat
To test if it works post the following commands to /chat:
1. !create testchannel (this creates a new channel called testchannel)
2. Post a chat message to this channel by supplying any message in json format with "channel" key and value "testchannel"
(testChannelMsg.json can be used)
3. !view testchannel (views messages posted to testchannel)
4. !channels (returns currently existing channels in a list)
